Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold. Ice Cube with activator when I\\'m aggravated. Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated. Two thousand feet, a thousand steps. I let it all sink to one thousand depths. Soon black balloons pop. Let it be the day the pain stop[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve\\'len]Hot pink, Valentine red. Black balloons, over my head. Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float. Let it float, let it float by me. Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float. Let it float, let it float by me. Hot pink, Valentine red. Black balloons, over my head. Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float. Let it float, let it float by me.

I tried to tell you that this life isn\\'t it. And I just wanna be the rightest I can be. Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be. Always show examples how they kill niggas like me. Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy. Sun is my attitude, so I\\'m cool like JAY-ZÁndale, ándale, my intelligence for threes. Cancel me like I ain\\'t the King of D.CCancel me like I ain\\'t the number one GCancel me like you don\\'t like \"Dance On Me\"Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies. You flashing all these lights, and you savin\\' these kids lives. And they hate you \\'cause you\\'re right, give me hell then, shit. Take your turn to fire and to pitchfork, bitch[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Twelve\\'len]Hot pink, Valentine red. Black balloons, over my head. Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float. Let it float, let it float by me. Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float. Let it float, let it float by me. Hot pink, Valentine red. Black balloons, over my head.

That\\'s how it goes down on the lower East Coast bitch. South Florida 21 getting older mind of a marine ever since I was a teen. Blowing up smithereens, living a broke man\\'s dream. Follow the roots of the prince till they crown me king. It seems, these niggas acting less than G\\'s. This ain\\'t the place that I choose to be. Where friends become strangers. Everybody wants to be a gangsta. It\\'s going down on the block, no anchor, story with no title![Chorus]Story with no title, everything is vital.

I was brought up inside a city that was built off cane. Even during my sunny days I am still a hurricane. I just wanna make it rain ain\\'t no aim ba-bay. Watching Bebe\\'s kids, we all Bebe\\'s kids. Little badass jits that\\'s where the story begins\\'Fore the end of the timeline, on to the crimes rise. Out here beefing ain\\'t no working at Five Guys. It\\'s wild, convicted felon put on trial. It\\'s sad, a mother outlives her child. And that\\'s bad, especially because we\\'re black. When the revolution start that\\'s when the niggas attack. I\\'m looking at the liars that say you ain\\'t come from riches. Stop calling our women bitches, fried chicken and watermelon’s.

Then they put him in the trash when they slide by the Beanz. Swerve, soon as I peel off the curve. Burn the evidence then a nigga hide. Take 27? Nah nigga, fuck that, let\\'s take that chance on the I-95Bumping that sickest shit with the vomit spit. And a 666 with a twist and twirl, if you survive homicide drive-by.

Witty, now you shitty with those saggy tig ol' bitties. And a flabby old ass, trying to look like Ms. Nicki. Picky, 'cause I say you look like Ms. Piggy. It's a damn shame that we the same pigment.

From the streets to the clubs, to the guns, to the cheddar. Till you get a phone call, email, or a letter. That your jit locked up or he dead on the stretcher. Better parenting is the main pressure. Your daughter got kids but wasn't taught about pleasure. Your kids are the treasure, the love you couldn't measure. Will end up in the hole if you don't get it together\",\n",

You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside. What it's 'bout?![Verse 1: Denzel Curry]It’s ‘bout a young nigga, running away from the moon to catch the sun quicker. Drug dealer, Nino with the steelo trying to sell kilos and grams. Settling angry stomachs up in his fam. So if that silver spoon on your plate, if you touch that, that's your fate. Don't have faith, Like Evans, you got to face demons to get to your heaven. The pimps is the prophets, not prophets for reverends, this is the lifestyle of a broke adolescent. So here's a lesson of a teen that survived Rikers. But shortly, his life had ended with a bullet that's made out of Midas. Touch[Chorus: J.K.

You don't have a fucking name on the darkside[Verse 2: J.K. The Reaper]Knew a young brother without a name, he was in love with his nina trapped. And steadily schemin', barely sleepin', but dreamin' of pretty bitches and beamers. But when he awake, he sees his fate. And his reality, to do whatever it takes to elevate his fucking salary. Any nigga's a casualty, kill 'em, rob 'em. Then casually walk off into the darkness, it all started. When he was, welcomed into our fucked up world, the son of a fucked up girl. And his father was just a blur, his life had took a curve. When he saw his brother dead on the curb, due to retaliation. Of the gang relation,  he was young, a kid, a baby. And yet to realize the pollution of the nation. Now he 18 life in jail is what he facin'Shit, murder was the case that they gave him. Shit, murder was the case when they raised him. Mind stuck in the all black prison. You think he give a fuck about the system?[Interlude](Car driving)Nigga we gotta get this money. Damn right.

As he cased out the bank,  he was catching that shank. Getting loaded the stick,  trying to major his rank. Thugging was how he was brought in the paint. Rush the security, no longer pure was thee. Soul turned it cold for the love of the gold. Bust in the air, everyone hit the floor. Not giving a fuck, loc-ing off of the 'dro. Bodied a nigga, riding in a dropped ‘Lac. Top back, cruising them twenty fours. So I went crazy, my vision got hazy. I walked in the bank, and I start to get bold. Clutching that pistol grip. The teller was moving too slow so I pistol-whipped. The bitch, he was twitching, bust at a civilian. And blasted the mag with no mask in the buildin’[Verse 4: Denzel Curry]Burn the fingertips off, replace the dental. Left the golden bullet magic in his coufie, no his temple. That’s engraved, leaving corpses. In graves, Glock 17 cutting fades. Barber,  we dumped the security in the harbor. Then we switched the identity, chose the name Leroy Carter. The bank teller looking short and squeamish. Steve pistol-whipped the bitch; she kept screaming. Shut up, ho, before a nigga nut up, ho. Steve said he couldn’t take the shit. So he took her to the back, then Steve grabbed the MACThen he put it to her head, and then he ripped the bitch. Bro, we gotta do a job or we might get toast13 shots rung out and it left two ghost.

They bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple. To bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom. With black on black tints, they jet in the rental. The young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel. With a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be?The fetus of a demon. Semen from the tip. Of the penis I'm the only thing. That you see when you're dreaming. Armageddon and aftermath. This may blog in paragraphs. Sit on a throne, full of X's and bones. Blowing smoke and I laugh. Turning sinners like you. Into my personal acid tabs. Let me put you up on game. I've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and. Still ain't deceased. I carry the mark of the beast. Now can you tell me. Who the fuck I be?Damien, as the kid replies. Wine, red wine was the color of his eyes. Coughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies. As his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life[Hook: Denzel Curry]And now that nigga scream like he Sindel. Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell. Running with them demons since the age of 12Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein. And now that nigga scream like he Sindel. Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell. Running with them demons since the age of 12Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein[Verse 2: Lil Ugly Mane]He thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position. Tried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in. Atrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in. And now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions. He fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness. Only sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance. Thinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions. He knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference. He used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit. And now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment. Cops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat. He's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth. But pops went to prison back in '03So lil man never got to listen to a OGNever got to tell him other options that you don't see. So lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly[Hook: Denzel Curry]And now that nigga scream like he Sindel. Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell.

Running with them demons since the age of 12Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein[Verse 3: Mike G]For the scene, see the best is never seen. They say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience. I remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation. Only way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga. Never compete, much less be winner at it. Seven days a week, I found my sinister. I control my perimeter, patrol isn't giving up. Every effort you attempt never amounts to enough. They talk around you, but you know you can't give in. And you part of the system, so they treat you just like them. Every action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen. Every student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah. I roll with what every character should have. That's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast. Now it's silent like when the Earth had begun. I am Genesis 1, this is God's work done\",\n",

Hella high, hella high so an angel can never fall. Smoking on the mystical chronic from a shaman. Disguised as Andre Young with razor blades under the tongue. Hopefully his speech impediments might call upon, petchulants. So he can rip the wings off Cosmo, and Pegasus. Eating Flapjacks with a cannibal Captain K\\'nuckles. Kamakaze, jeepers creepers, read the power, ate his tonsils. Threw it up, gave it to an asthmatic. Swapping spit with crack addicts, Complex magazine and mathematics. Dilated with the ganja and peripherals. I look at things as cynical, I put the fun in funeral. A misty, mystic, mischievous one. Burning papers of the book, Fahrenheit 451[Chorus]Can you see what I see?Look at life in 3D (Widescreen)Can you see what I see?Look at life in 3D (Widescreen)Can you see what I see?Look at life in 3D (Widescreen)Can you see what I see?Look at life in 3D (Widescreen)[Verse 2]Trying to achieve the same color as tile sky forest.

Wickedly sticking these bitches, G\\', I\\'m Ice Cube Jackson5 fingers of death, I\\'m packing. Something that will make you feel like a paraplegic. Paralyzed when folks no habla murder thesis. Told based god I\\'d give him a virgin sacrifice. And stepped into a Pantheon and said \"Yo, which one you like?\"Step to Aphrodite with an amethyst rock. Crystal, get it dog? nah that\\'s a Shih Tzu. If you don\\'t really get the moral of the song. Basically, I see crazy shit, when I grip the bong. So maybe right now, you know what that means.

Avenger, but yet I be the Joker and the Riddler. With a mindset that\\'s switched like Harvey Denture\\'s dent. The Dark Knight, fuck a Clark Kent. Martin Lawrence when he traveled back in time with suspense. Suspended, animation when my brain reacts. Don\\'t belong in this world like I\\'m Samurai Jack.

Once when we get a little older. Hopefully we\\'ll push a little baby in a stroller. Lower. Is the tone she whispered in my ear. She said \"I love you Denny and I love you near and dear\"Never knew Nasir. But the words were sincere. When I went inside her mind, it was like Revista Leer. I read between the lines. In her eyes I spot a tear. I uttered to her softly, girl you have nothing to fear. I kiss her on the lips. Then she told me to come here. As she climbed to the top. She became my chandelier. Not knowing. Created another life this very moment. The future of my very insistence\\'s got me open. Its potent. Like the smoke, when its in my lungs. Its a fire in the air. With the greeting of the tongues. But none. Will ever come between me and her bond. So leave my sanctuary don\\'t come back and don\\'t respond. This my garden of Eden. But as one this is our temple.

We sticking together like metal and magnets. Lutrashious, me and Mercedes up in the condo. On the phone for nine months, we sparked the conversation. Enter the void, mind escaping. Racing, plus my heart rate went blazing. Ganja, as I ponder on graduation. Threats hit a nigga, the points where I could make it. Not a contract, could take what I created. Not on paper, my clan-name erased it. Down nigga, since day one, I never hate shit. Same nigga tat 2-7-5 on the pavement. Got highs and lows on one path of greatness. Eighteen years of life, larger than basic. Markese, Andrew, Darnell, et cetera. It's still my niggas, know things will get better but. Things take time, and all things change. Some people venture off and make they own lane. But the place is just the same from the F.L.ABut my cuzzo Chynaman got hit with the eight from the clip. And my nigga William had his last trip. When he hung his self in his room. Roll up the spliff as I puff one, puff two for my niggas. Then three for the niggas that be hating. Nigga, I don't care, Aquarius Killa, the Mack. Talk your girl up out her underwear. Let me bite that pussy like a god damn juicy bear. Suicidal thoughts, I'm on my head to make it clear. Another life and day, hallucinate got me in my rear.

Date. Hey, young boy had to penetrate. Face, young boy done caught a case. Bang, now his mama livin\\' with the pain. Wait, doctor says he\\'s gonna stay. Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate. Now a nigga harder than the head of the state. Denzel Curry is the new candidate. Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite. Stop this shit, chop your esophagus. Bitches be boppin\\' it, bow down and pop it in. Droppin\\' it in her esophagus. She get so nasty, in public she classy. Perhaps she is able to swallow it. Girl, I can make you a star. Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch. Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness. Narcissist, part time an arsonist. Rippin\\' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch. Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus. Dearly departed, it\\'s done when it started. So now that I\\'m livin\\' so harmonious. Feelin\\' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate. I am the best, there\\'s no politics. Bitch I\\'m ultimate. Ultimate[Chorus]I am the one, don\\'t weigh a ton. Don\\'t need a gun to get respect up on the street. Under the sun, the bastard son. Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family. By any means, your enemies, my enemies. We wet them up like a canteen. The yellow tape surrounds the fate. Don\\'t have a face, so now you late, open the gates[Verse 2]Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium. Open the internet, photosynthesis. Put up parentheses, temporary. Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry. Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life. But yet the question is, \"Is he fake? Is he real?\"What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up. I\\'ma sever it when I sever shit. I kill \\'em, no Kony, these niggas ain\\'t homies. Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly. Droppin\\' melodic, enter the cosmic. Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic. Flow like a foreigner, I\\'m the torturer. Out of South Florida, call the coroner. Killed in the corridor, I\\'m the overlord. Rhymes like a sorcerer, I\\'m an animorph. Bitch, I\\'m a beast. Nigga, you tell me who fuckin\\' with me. K to the I to the N to the GClaim you the hottest, but I disagree. Better learn something and get a degree. This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.PArrivederci, bitches lookin\\' thirsty. Ridin\\' through the dirty, like it\\'s mandatory. Ending of the story. I\\'m ultimate. Ultimate[Chorus]I am the one, don\\'t weigh a ton. Don\\'t need a gun to get respect up on the street. Under the sun, the bastard son. Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family. By any means, your enemies, my enemies. We wet them up like a canteen. The yellow tape surrounds the fate. Don\\'t have a face, so now you late, open the gates[Outro]Ultimate. BADBADNOTGOODGood, good, not bad. Oh, you mad? That\\'s sad. Aye, aye, ULT',\n",

I just need it - I’m anemic and I know it’s critical. And I’m sorry if I up the stick and have to click on you. I ain't going back to jail, nigga, fuck the feds. If I gotta kill a nigga, gotta cut the dreads. Put him in his spot, nigga, run the bread. Before I nut up put a gun to your head. Z3 yeah Z4, frankly I don’t know. Posted sellin' green so not no mo’, cause a nigga is tired of being broke. And I’m tired of living at my folks. My old girl need some help. And my girlfriend bout to have a jit. Plus I don’t want him growing up saying daddy never had shit. Daddy never had it, but based on analysis. I never seen challenges, I look at his Roley I know that he flashin' it. I wouldn't mind seeing blood just like I got off dialysis Lord of the dark and violent. Only know imperial niggas move in silence, look that old boy yeah you shining. Steve got gold, and his girl got diamonds. Hopping in the whip, two niggas riding. We all gon die nigga fuck reclining, we all got 5 let's get behind em. Let's go get em[Chorus]Who’s that peeking in my window?Baby, please pass the extendo. Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo. Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero. I said who’s that peeking in my window?Baby, please pass the extendo. Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo. Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero[Verse 2]I been seeing, watching cause these niggas got it in for me. Flexing flashy wrists is correlating with my golden teeth. Diamonds all around a neck and it came with a diamond ring. I done seen all kind of shit, what niggas do over finer things. That’s why I carry the 9 on me that’s a three times three extendo, that’s a 10-4Seen them niggas on the 191, but a nigga peep game on the 194Woah, bending corners just to see if they followed us. Sweating bullets, heater under my cardigan. These type of niggas is known to be poppin' shit. Deep in my thoughts, know who the prophet is. Tryna to take my wealth, gotta protect my wifey and my jit. Gotta set an example if you thinkin' I'm a walking lick. Never believed in lawlessness, but I could be with the shits. When I’m nervous it's dangerous, if the police pull up, then I tell em I’m innocent. They tried to run down on us, swore that the clip I might empty it. Lords of the dark and violent, just ended up on the pavement, quiet. This is the reason why niggas divided, pray to the lord I don’t get indicted. Send me all the way to Rikers Island, dead on the ground now he’s a carcass. That’s our guy, that’s our target. Let’s go get em[Chorus]Who’s that peeking in my window?Baby, please pass the extendo. Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo. Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero. I said who’s that peeking in my window?Baby, please pass the extendo. Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo. Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero[Outro]Aye. Ay yo kill that shit, jam the fuck out. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
